          Workflows are a good example of this. Rather than disorganized email
          threads, phone calls that we assume people are following up, and
          checking in with the team every day, there&apos;s a centralized place
          for this. And simply <i>having</i> the feature makes people ask how
          they could use it, thus leading to better processes. Calendar and the
          approvals built in are another good example of this. The church
          I&apos;m at now would have never had a process for event approvals
          before.

        Both at the smaller church I&apos;m at now and especially at Hillsong,

        Multi-site is also hard with Church Center, esp. if each campus wants to

                I really wish Teams were not tied to service types. It makes

                It might just be me, but profile matching <i>never</i> works for
                me in People. This has been true at both Good Shepherd and
                Hillsong. I know there&apos;s the remote ID, but I can never get
                that to work either and I can&apos;t find much support stuff on
                it. So in the past (and for Church Space) I&apos;ve had to build
                my own profile matching and linking logic.

                I&apos;ve built this one out as well, but I would love to have a
                content platform where I can do team trainings, make and host
                small group content, and be able to share resources with and
                access resources from other churches. (Article on this concept
                and how it can be used with forms, website pages, content, etc.
                soon.)
